![Design preview for the Base Apparel coming soon page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

## Notes
### Used: 
* CSS + JS
* Bulma
### Time to complete:
